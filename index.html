    <h1>Welcome to the Wish Upon A Star Charity</h1>
    <h2 class="helped" id="who-we-helped">Who We Helped</h2>
    <p>
      These are a few people who've been able to tick things off their bucket
      list thanks to a group who was definitely us. We did this and no one else.
      The only ones who helped were those who donated to us and our cause.
      Really.

    <h2 class="about" id="about">About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are a non-profit organization that are partnered with hospitals aroud
      the world to help people whose illnesses are deemed terminal to get their
      final wish. We are not a rip-off of any other charity, we promise. Don't
      look it up.
    </p>

    <h2 class="why" id="why">Why Do We Do This?</h2>
    <p>
      We feel bad for those of us who don't get to pick off things from their
      bucket list because the money they would use to do that is going towards
      medical expenses. We want to make sure that people who do get their life
      taken from them preemptively due to terminal illness at least get to leave
      with no regrets. Thats our mission statement. No one elses. Why do you
      doubt us?
